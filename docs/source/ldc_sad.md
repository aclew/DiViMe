# LDC SAD

## General intro

LDC SAD relies on HTK (Young et al., 2002) to band-pass filter and extract PLP features, prior to applying a broad phonetic class recognizer trained on the Buckeye Corpus (Pitt et al., 2002) using a GMM-HMM model. An official release by the LDC is currently in the works.
